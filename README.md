# chrome-whatsapp-dark-mode

Enables WhatsApp web native dark mode

## How it works

WhatsApp web has a hidden dark mode that can be enabled by adding the `dark` class to the `body` element.  
All this extension does it automatically add that class when the page loads.

## Limitations

WhatsApp web dark mode is still not complete (that's why it's not available from the UI yet).
Some parts of the app might not have a dark theme yet.
